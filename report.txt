\section{The System}

\subsection{Definition of the System}
The system under development is an AI-Integrated Quiz Web Application designed to create an engaging, interactive, and intelligent platform for quiz-based learning and evaluation. This system allows users to take topic-specific and difficulty-based quizzes while providing detailed performance feedback generated through Gemini Generative AI APIs. It includes two main roles: Users who play quizzes, and Admins who manage content and configure quizzes. 

The application is built using the MEAN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js — and follows a modular, scalable architecture. It supports features like secure authentication, AI-powered question generation and explanation, quiz history tracking, and leaderboard rankings. 

\subsection{Purpose and Objectives }
The primary purpose of this system is to offer a smart, personalized, and automated quiz-taking experience that adapts to users’ learning levels and interests. By integrating AI capabilities, the system can dynamically generate questions and explanations, thereby reducing manual effort and enhancing learning outcomes. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop a full-stack web application for quizzes using the MEAN stack. 

    \item To provide users with quizzes based on selected topics and difficulty levels. 

    \item To allow admins to manage quizzes through manual input, external APIs (OpenTDB), or AI-powered generation. 

    \itemTo offer personalized feedback using AI, helping users understand their mistakes and improve. 

    \item To maintain quiz history, user performance records, and leaderboard statistics. 

    \item To implement a secure and role-based access system using JWT. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{ About the Present System}
Currently, most quiz platforms rely on static sets of questions, offering limited flexibility and minimal personalization. The present systems often: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Lack adaptive quiz generation based on user preferences. 
    \item Do not provide instant or intelligent feedback. 

    \item Depend heavily on manual question entry and curation. 

    \item Are limited in scope for dynamically generated content and explanations. 

    \itemDon’t integrate with modern AI technologies to enhance learning experiences. 
\end{itemize}
These limitations result in a generic, one-size-fits-all experience, where users receive little to no insight into their mistakes and are not challenged based on their learning progress. 

\subsection{Proposed System}
The proposed \textbf{AI-Integrated Quiz Web Application} addresses the shortcomings of the present system by offering the following features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AI-Generated Questions and Explanations:} \\
    Utilizing \textbf{Gemini Generative AI}, the system can automatically generate quiz questions and provide detailed, AI-driven explanations for user responses.
    
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Quiz Generation:} \\
    Users can customize their quiz experience by selecting desired topics and difficulty levels. The system dynamically adapts and generates quizzes accordingly.
    
    \item \textbf{Multiple Quiz Modes:} \\
    Administrators have flexibility in quiz creation --- they can:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Manually add questions
        \item Import from \textbf{OpenTDB APIs}
        \item Use AI to generate entire quizzes automatically
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{User and Admin Dashboards:} \\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Users:} Access dashboards to play quizzes, view history, and track progress.
        \item \textbf{Admins:} Manage users, questions, and quizzes efficiently from their dedicated dashboard.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Secure Login \& Role Management:} \\
    Authentication and authorization are handled using \textbf{JWT (JSON Web Token)}, ensuring secure access with role-based controls.
    
    \item \textbf{Leaderboard and Performance Tracking:} \\
    Users can view their ranks, performance analytics, and quiz history to track improvement over time.
    
    \item \textbf{Modern Frontend with Angular:} \\
    Built with \textbf{Angular 19}, using \textbf{standalone components} and \textbf{Tailwind CSS} for a responsive, clean, and modern user interface.
\end{itemize}

This intelligent system not only automates quiz creation and evaluation but also significantly \textbf{enhances user engagement} through AI-powered personalization --- delivering a smarter and more scalable approach to quiz-based assessments.
